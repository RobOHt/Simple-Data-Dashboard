# Streamlit Web App
This is a simple web app built using Streamlit, a powerful Python library that allows for quick creation of web apps for data analysis and machine learning projects.

## What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is an open-source app framework specifically designed for Machine Learning and Data Science projects. It enables developers to create beautiful, interactive web apps with only a few lines of Python code.

## App Link
You can access the web app via this link on Streamlit Community Cloud: [https://simple-data-dashboard-ppd6utqk9cw746ltbcetur.streamlit.app/]

## How to Use
Just open the link to interact with the web app directly in your browser. No additional setup required. However, there seems to be an issue with Streamlit Community Cloud on iOS devices, so using a computer is the safer option.
